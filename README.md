(Not to be confused with "Jumper Planet", the third Jumper Planet game)
# Jumper Planet 1.0
This is the very first Jumper Planet ever, it was always the same map. Only had 4 obbies. This is the source for it.
Contains very bad code, avoid using this to learn
# !! Jumper Planet 1.0 won't be updated by InsertSoda. He also won't help fix any bugs !!
